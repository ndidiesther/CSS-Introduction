        <p>
          My interest in technology started while i was in school, the first
          time I used tehnology in performing a task was my third year in
          school. We were asked to design a digital circuit which employed the
          use of technology. My team chose to work on implementing a smart
          digital clock. It wasn't an easy one for us but it introduced me to
          programming and how to get things done seamlessly. During the course
          of the project, we encountered a lot of dificulties but it only helped
          in igniting a desire to pursue a career in technology.
          <br />
          <br />
          Over the few years, my interest in and love for technologyhas
          increased and I derive pleasure in learning new tech skills and
          improving on my existing tech skills. Technology has the ability to
          impact lives at a level and scale that has never been realized in the
          history of mankind. The idea that something I create can impact
          someone across the world now, or in the future is what drives my
          passion for Technology.

        <p><b>What I Learnt so Far</b></p>
        <p>
          CSS stands for <i><b>Cascading Styles Sheet</b></i
          >. It is used for website layout in design and used alongside HTML.
          CSS is a styling language. Along with HTML, CSS is fundamental to web
          design. Without it, websites would still be plain text on white
          backgrounds. There are three major ways of applying CSS to your HTML
          and these includes
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Inline Styling:</b> Here you add your CSS styling in the opening
            tag of your HTML Elements as a style attribute.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Internal styling:</b> An internal CSS is used to define a style
            for a single HTML page. It is defined in the 'head' section of an
            HTML page, within a 'style' element.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>External Styling:</b> An external file is used to define the
            styling in this method for any HTML page, This method of styling can
            be used by more than one HTML page.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Also, there are various CSS Selectors which includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Universal CSS Selector:</b> Selects every Element in the HTML
            file
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>CSS Element Selector:</b> CSS Element Selector is also known as a
            Type selector.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>CSS ID Selector:</b> CSS ID selector helps the developer to match
            the ID created by the developer to its styling content.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b> CSS Class Selector:</b>
            The CSS Class selector is one of the most helpful selectors of all
            the selectors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b> CSS Class Attribute Selector:</b> The CSS Attribute selector
            styles content according to the attribute and the attribute value
            mentioned in the square brackets.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I also learnt about some of the most fundamental concepts of CSS; the
          cascade, specificity, and inheritance, which control how CSS is
          applied to HTML and how conflicts between style declarations are
          resolved. Finally, I also learnt about the box-model and major CSS
          properties which include comments, colors, background properties,
          positions, shorthand property, border, margin, padding, CSS height,
          width and maximum width, outline, outline style, text alignment, and
          text direction, CSS text decoration, and lists.
        </p>
        <p><b>Importance of CSS</b></p>
        <p>
          CSS allowed several innovations to webpage layout, such as the ability
          to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Specify fonts other than the default for the browser</li>
          <li>Specify color and size of text and links</li>
          <li>Apply colors to backgrounds</li>
          <li>
            Contain webpage elements in boxes and float those boxes to specific
            positions on the page
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>
          <!-- Third section -->
        </h4>
        <p><b>Padding, Margins and Borders</b></p>
        <p>
          <b><i>Paddings</i></b>
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the space between the element and the related content inside it.
          It determines how elements look and sit within a container. It also
          shows the container background around the element in it. Padding can
          be affected by background colors as it clears the area around the
          content. To create the gap, it either grows the element size or
          shrinks the content inside. By default, the size of the element
          increases.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b><i>Margins</i></b>
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the space around an element. Margins are used to move an element
          up or down on a page as well as left or right. Margin is completely
          transparent, and it does not have any background color. It clears the
          area around the element. Each side of the element has a margin size
          you can change individually. In creating the gap, the margin pushes
          adjacent elements away
        </p>
        <p>
          <b><i>Borders</i></b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The CSS border is a shorthand property used to set the border on an
          element. The CSS border properties are use to specify the style, color
          and size of the border of an element.
